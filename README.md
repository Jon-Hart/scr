Torque Scripts
---------
These scripts allow you to run a variety of different programs using the Torque scheduler.  They are written with tcsh shell in mind(which was the shell of our local HPC when we started).

Generally the .sh scripts take a "samples" file in and queue up many different programs into the queue.  The format of the samples is generally: "prefix input_file output_dir"
